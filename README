# RoyaleBook Translations
RoyaleBook languages are organized in xliff files, whose names follows the following rule: [file_name].[language].xlf. This kind of files can be edited using a text editor.

## Start a new translation
Let's suppose you would like to help translating RoyaleBook in French. What you need to do is:

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the English dictionaries files to new ones and change the language to fr
3. Translate the files
4. Pull request your work

## How to translate
All xliff entries looks like this one:

    <trans-unit id="welcome">
        <source>welcome</source>
        <target>Welcome!</target>
    </trans-unit>

To translate this unit you just need to work on the **<target>** element. The result looks as follows:

    <trans-unit id="welcome">
        <source>welcome</source>
        <target>Bienvenue!</target>
    </trans-unit>

Thank you for helping
The RoyaleBook staff
